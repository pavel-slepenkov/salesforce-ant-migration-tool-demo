 <h1>Force.com Migration Tool</h1>
    <p>This is the Winter '16 version of the Force.com Migration Tool. The Force.com Migration Tool is a Java/Ant-based command-line utility for moving metadata between a local directory and
        a Salesforce organization. For more information, see the <a href="http://wiki.developerforce.com/page/Migration_Tool_Guide#Official_Documentation">Force.com Migration Tool Guide</a>.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<ol>
 <li>Download <a
     href="http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi">Apache Ant</a>, version 1.6
     or newer. </li>
 <li>To ensure that the
     appropriate environment variables are set for Ant, follow the instructions
     in <a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/install.html">Installing Ant</a>.
</li>
<li>If your network requires an
     HTTP proxy, follow the instructions in <a
     href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/proxy.html">Proxy Configuration</a>. </li>
</ol>
    <u>Note</u>: The Force.com Migration Tool uses the <code>ant-salesforce.jar</code> file that's in the distribution zip. 
    If you have another version of <code>ant-salesforce.jar</code> in the Ant installation <code>lib</code> directory, delete it to ensure that the latest version from the zip file is used. 
    You don't need to copy this jar file to your Ant installation <code>lib</code> directory.

<h2>Deploying Sample Metadata</h2>

<ol>
 <li>Go to the <a href="sample">sample</a>
     subdirectory. </li>
 <li>Open the <a
     href="sample/build.properties">build.properties</a> file and make the following substitutions:
<ul> <li><code>sf.username</code> - a
     valid Salesforce username</li>
<li><code>sf.password</code> - a
     valid Salesforce password<br/>
If you are using a security token,
paste the 25-digit token value to the end of your password.</li>
<li><code>sf.serverurl</code> - the Salesforce server URL <br/>A sandbox or Developer Edition organization is strongly recommended for testing.</li></ul>
     <u>Note</u>: If you want to use a Salesforce session for authentication instead of a username and password, uncomment the <code>sf.sessionId</code> property and provide a valid session ID. Also,
     make sure to comment out the <code>sf.username</code> and <code>sf.password</code> properties.</li>
 <li>Open a command shell and navigate to the <code>sample</code> subdirectory.</li>
 <li>Run <code>ant test</code>. <br/>
This will deploy sample metadata into your organization and retrieve it again into a local directory. Look for the custom object <code>myobj</code> and its corresponding page layout in your organization, and go to <code>sample/retrieveOutput</code> to see the results of the retrieve.</li>
</ol>
<p>The sample <code>build.xml</code> contains other targets illustrating various deploy and retrieve options. Run <code>ant -p</code> to list the build targets.</p>
<h2>Using Deploy and Retrieve</h2>

<p>Use the deploy and retrieve tasks to create, update, and
retrieve metadata. This reference lists the attributes available for each task.</p>

<h3>Deploy</h3>

<p>The <b>deploy</b> task uses a set of Salesforce metadata

the end of your password.</dd>
